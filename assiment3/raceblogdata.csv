Damp but drying conditions at the fourth race of the season at Imola gave some indication how closely cars could race each other without DRS and after it was activated. Race control gave the go-ahead for DRS to be used on lap 34, at which point several teams had already asked for it to be switched on.
Ferrari was one of them. As Charles Leclerc pursued the Red Bull drivers he was told on his radio his team had “asked for” DRS but that the “race director thinks turn two off-line is wet”. The corner – Tamburello – was the scene of a high-speed crash in similar conditions during last year’s race after DRS was activated.
Ricciardo made an extra pit stop before DRS was activated and ran near the rear of the field. He believes that despite changes made to encourage overtaking this year, F1 cars still need DRS to race well.
“Don’t get me wrong, the cars are better this year to follow, and there was a small improvement already [at Imola],” he said.
“But still, I don’t know, did anyone pass without it? You still need it. I know some people are not that much in favour of DRS these days, but I’m definitely still a DRS kind of person.”
DRS is still needed because cars don’t gain as much from following others on the straights this year, says Ricciardo.
“You can follow better, so you can definitely stay closer, but the slipstream effect is smaller than last year I feel, at least. So you do need DRS to make that straight-line advantage bigger. Although you can stay closer, you don’t get a crazy, crazy effect like maybe last year.
“But I think that probably changes track-to-track as well, depending on the size of wing cars are running. So I think it still needs it. Of course then you can shorten, length zones. They can play with the distance of DRS, but at least some distance is good.”

Some passes were made before DRS was activated. Leclerc took Lando Norris, Guanyu Zhou passed Mick Schumacher and Kevin Magnussen lost places to George Russell and Valtteri Bottas.
Albon passed Gasly without DRS and kept him behind despite itAlexander Albon also overtook Pierre Gasly without using DRS. But once DRS was activated it did not produce a sudden spate of extra passes. “For whatever reason even with the DRS I don’t know for what reason but this year was very tough to pass,” the AlphaTauri driver remarked.
Albon believes the nature of the Imola track explains why little passing occured before or after DRS was activated.
“I still think the cars are better for overtaking, better for for racing,” he said. “It’s just this track’s quite tricky.
“We only have one DRS point. Of course it’s not great to always have DRS overtakes, but this track’s hard. There’s not really a place where you can brake late and overtake it’s all quite quick, which stops the overtaking.”
Last year Max Verstappen suggested Imola should have a second DRS zone on the downhill run to the penultimate corner, a few Albon backed.
“I think we need a bit of a revision,” he said. “Maybe a DRS down the the straight before the last two corners or something as well. But it’s a tricky track this one.”

In brief
Alfa Romeo “will be strong” around Miami circuit, predicts Pujolar

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




Alfa Romeo’s head of trackside engineering, Xevi Pujolar, predicts that the Miami Grand Prix circuit will suit their car’s strengths next weekend.
The team currently sit fifth in the constructors’ championship, having acquired 25 points over the first four rounds. Pujolar believes that the Miami circuit will suit the car better than Imola, where Valtteri Bottas scored their best result of the season so far with fifth.
“We expect to be stronger than in Imola,” Pujolar said. “I think the type of layout could maybe suit us a bit better.
“Now we’ve got an idea – we’ve got a layout in the simulator and everything – but how actually it will look, we’ll have to find out when we are there. So we’ll see. It’s kind of a layout that I think we will be strong, but we’ll have to see in terms of the tarmac and everything what actually what it will be. But everyone has a lot of expectation and for us now with the package and everything, fighting with Alpine and McLaren is very encouraging for us.”
IndyCar lacking “buzz” around racing – Rossi
Alexander Rossi says IndyCar would benefit from creating more “buzz” around itself.
Speaking ahead of yesterday’s Grand Prix of Alabama at Barber, Rossi praised the quality of racing in IndyCar but said the series needs to create greater excitement around itself away from the track.
“I think we all have to remember we are an entertainment property, ultimately,” said Rossi. “That is what we are. That’s why we always talk about the show. That’s why we’re always interested in improving that with car updates. It’s talks and conversations we always have. I think IndyCar is aware of that.
“I think the on-track product is not necessarily the issue, right? It’s creating that buzz around it that we lack, that we struggle in. I think that takes someone much smarter than me… to figure out. 
Evans “lucky” to take second after energy issues in Monaco
Mitch Evans says he and his Jaguar team were “lucky” to finish second in the Monaco EPrix after he had to carry out more energy saving than he anticipated in the race.
Evans had started from pole position and lead the early laps until he had to back off to conserve energy. The Jaguar driver admits he “got a bit of a shock” after the team had figured out his energy level. 
“We had a clear strategy and obviously got the lead at the start,” Evans explained. “For the first few laps, I was under-consuming. Everything for our plan was looking strong until we got the energies and got a bit of a shock when I when I heard I was down on energy.
“It was quite stressful and I think we recovered really well. I think to get second today we were very lucky. We’ll analyse things – obviously something’s gone wrong somewhere because the car felt fine, but just the efficiency and the energy wasn’t quite there.”

One year later, the McLaren SP driver turned the tables on pole winner Rinus VeeKay, and won Sunday’s fourth round of the 2022 IndyCar Series ahead of defending champion Álex Palou.
The pivotal moment of the race came at the end of lap 61, when VeeKay and O’Ward pitted together from first and second position. VeeKay had been the dominant driver of the day, leading 57 laps. Exiting their stalls, VeeKay was still ahead of O’Ward as they rejoined the track.
But with a brilliant lunge around the outside of the turn five hairpin, O’Ward snatched the effective  lead of the race away from the Carpenter driver. Once the rest of the field made their final stops, O’Ward was in the lead by lap 64.
Palou made his final stop on lap 63 and was able to ‘overcut’ VeeKay into second place. While VeeKay eventually faded from reach of the top spot, Palou was able to stay within two seconds of the leader on a used set of the harder, primary tyres.
But unlike last year, when Palou overhauled O’Ward for the lead en route to the win, this time O’Ward had the measure of his rival and claimed victory by just under a second. It was an important win for the McLaren SP driver, turning around a poor start to the season which began with finishes of 12th and 15th, before improving to fifth at Long Beach. His first win of the season is the third of his career.
Second place for Palou but last year’s winner in the lead of the championship lead, heading into the Month of May at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, with 144 points. VeeKay will be disappointed after finishing third, but with his first podium since the Detroit GP race two, he has now fully bounced back from the training injury he suffered last June.
Will Power was the hard charger of the race, rising from 19th to finish fourth. He was on the move in the final stint, using a fresh set of alternate compound tyres to pass Scott Dixon and Scott McLaughlin. Dixon took fifth ahead of McLaughlin, who lies second in the championship after four races.
Romain Grosjean finished seventh after a heated on-track battle with Graham Rahal in the closing laps as the two bashed wheels while jockeying for position. Rahal ran out of fuel on the final tour, but was able to keep a place in the top 10, ahead of Alexander Rossi in ninth, and Colton Herta – who spun trying to lunge past McLaughlin – in tenth.
Grosjean and Herta were among a number of drivers who committed early to a three-stop strategy, but a full-course caution on lap 32 for Callum Ilott spinning off at the Museum corner complex (turn seven) proved detrimental to their chances of winning the race over those that opted for a two-stop strategy.
Another driver who tried the three-stop strategy was Josef Newgarden, who went into the weekend with the championship lead. He finished 13th after losing out to the likes of Herta and Grosjean over the second half of the race, and now slips to third in points.
The Grand Prix of Indianapolis is next on the calendar, taking place on Saturday, 14 May at the Indy road course.

Over the years, the Milestone-developed official Moto GP game series has steadily grown into perhaps the most underrated major licenced racing franchise on the market. Of course, hardcore Moto GP fans will have plenty of gripes about the series and some of the minutiae of the gameplay, but from the accessibility for newcomers, the depth of challenge offered by the handling model and the volume of content available, the Moto GP license has never been in better hands than with Milestone.
Just days ago, the series announced Milestone would continue to hold exclusive licencing rights for Moto GP games until 2026. So what’s new with Moto GP 22, the second edition of the game released on current-generation hardware and is the investment in a brand new entry worth it for those who already own Moto GP 21?
All the 2022 Moto GP class teams and riders are presentFor a start, it will come of little surprise to learn that Moto GP 22 is another evolutionary step in the series and not a dramatic reinvention on a whole new game engine. If you’ve played any of the last few games, you’ll find plenty familiar in this latest version.
All the teams and riders from this Moto GP season are present, including the new Indonesian Grand Prix circuit at Mandalika, but in typical fashion, the Moto 2 and Moto 3 classes have not yet been fully updated with all the rider liveries, helmet designs and rider images. As ever, those will be added post-launch in a free update.
On track, Moto GP offers the same kind of deep and rewarding handling model it has offered over the last few years. This is not an arcade game, but an authentic light-simulation game that can be surprisingly challenging to master if you’ve never tried before. These machines are savage – especially in the premier class. Asking too much of the bike at any point, under braking, throughout the corner, on exit, or by running onto the kerbs, can unsettle the bike and cause it to completely lose contact with the road, sending your rider hurtling through the air into the gravel.
Thankfully, there are plenty of assists available to make things less of an ordeal, but even with most of the riding assists enabled, you should not expect to be able to jump onto Marc Marquez’s Honda or Jack Miller’s Ducati and start throwing yourself around the track.
Braking has been modified to try and offer a little more forgiveness than last year, which could see the more powerful machines be very difficult to slow down effectively without riding aids. A new suspension model can make the bikes more predictable over kerbs and rumble strips, but do not confuse ‘predictable’ to mean ‘easier’. New for this year, the adjustable ride height system allows you to optimise your drag on starts and out of corners with a touch of a button, even being able to pre-arm the system in a corner before it automatically activates on the straight.
Riding these bikes can be very challengingFor beginners, the helpful tutorial mode from last year’s game returns from 2021, teaching players all the basic and advanced mechanics in controlled tests. For those who want a bit more practice, there is now a new academy mode, which functions almost identically to the ‘circuit experience’ mode in Gran Turismo 7. Breaking down each circuit into its sectors, you can tackle each sector of a track at a time, with bronze, silver and gold target times to aim for. It’s supposed to help you learn the circuits and improve your knowledge of every section of every circuit. However, it’s unlikely to really help those already experienced to learn anything new about their technique or help them improve their times.
New for this year is the so-called ‘Riding Analysis System’, which claims to help players improve their skills by offering feedback on their performance on track. However, this amounts to pop ups after races, simply suggesting that you might want to check out the tyre management tutorial simply because your tyre wear was high in your last race – hardly the most helpful of feedback systems.
At the heart of the game, once again, is the managerial career mode. Remaining almost functionally identical to 2021, career mode allows you to create your rider and choose whether to start in Moto 3, Moto 2 or jump straight into the premier class. As you progress, you can create your own team and even start your own academy, making decisions about hiring and firing staff on the way and setting development paths for your bike on the way.
It’s certainly more detailed and deep an experience than many other racing games would provide, but it’s hard not to feel a sense of deja vu if you’ve owned any of the previous two titles. What Moto GP lacks compared to the current Formula 1 series is a dynamic rider market and progression from junior categories for younger riders. Without that, it’s hard to feel as invested long term as you progress through the seasons. One welcome option this year however is the ability to choose shortened championship options, with fewer races in a year. A handy way to help enjoy the lower categories as you progress while helping to make sure the experience never feels dragged out if you lack the time to invest.
Nine Season guides players through the 2009 championshipHowever, the career mode is not the major focus of this latest game. Instead, Moto GP 22’s major headline feature is something no racing game has attempted to do before. In the Nine Season mode, Moto GP 22 offers players a unique lookback at one of the most memorable seasons in Moto GP history: 2009 – Valentino Rossi’s seventh and final top class title winning season.
Presented as a cinematic retelling of the 2009 championship featuring heavy use of archive footage and a documentary-style narrator, Nine Season breaks down every race of that year’s championship into its key narratives and turns those into gameplay challenges for the player to complete as they navigate through the events of the season.
What could easily have been a half-baked addition to the game for marketing purposes is actually executed with genuine brilliance. It is clear how much effort and time has gone into the Nine Season mode, with the quality of the cutscenes and the way real life footage blends almost seamlessly into the gameplay making it a truly impressive experience. Even if you have no knowledge or little appreciation for the history of Moto GP, the mode does an excellent job of setting the scene of each race and making you invested in the characters – arguably more effectively that Moto GP’s own ‘Unlimited’ documentary series managed.
Hardcore fans of Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedrosa will get the most enjoyment from reliving iconic moments through gameplay, but it is still deeply rewarding to go through a specific period in racing history and relive it through gameplay. It’s wise to wait until you’re more familiar with the game before jumping into Nine Season, as you’ll be thrown into racing scenarios and expected to catch rivals or pull gaps on bikes behind on circuits and bikes that you may be completely unfamiliar with. But this is a far more meaty and substantial mode than what many could have expected and far more rewarding a journey to go through than say, F1 2021’s Braking Point mode.
As well as the Nine Season narrative mode, Moto GP 22 also includes every rider, bike and circuit from the 2009 season to race with in any of the non-career single player modes. With many historic bikes and riders from previous games returning in this year’s game, there can be few complaints about the volume of content available in the game.
Customisation remains unchanged from 2021As ever, the customisation features from the previous few games return, but it’s still a little disappointing to have no freedom to completely design your bike livery from scratch à la GT7 or Forza. 
The game looks and sounds as pleasant as ever, making impressive use of the Unreal engine with colourful, bright image quality that the photo mode makes great use of. The use of the old Dorna TV graphics package for the Nine Season mode is an especially nice touch, while the menus and HUD feel slick and modern taking heavy inspiration from the sport’s current visual branding.
The answer to the overall question of whether Moto GP 22 is worth a full-price purchase is as ever dependent on how much of a hardcore Moto GP fanatic you are. But with all the content of 2021, small handling refinements and the addition of the super Nine Season mode to play through, it’s easy to recommend Moto GP 22 to anyone interested in picking up a Moto GP game for the first time.
With Milestone owning the rights to the Moto GP licence for the next few years, it will be exciting to see where this talented Italian development team take the series into the future.

In brief
‘I have to get on Albon’s level’, accepts Latifi

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




Nicholas Latifi says he knows he needs to get on the same level of performance as Williams team mate Alex Albon.
Latifi currently sits bottom of the drivers’ championship, one of only two drivers yet to score their first point of the season. He admits he is struggling with a lack of confidence in car – even on the straights. 
“It’s everywhere,” Latifi said. “As soon as you’re not flat out through the straights, that’s when it starts.
“Obviously Alex is clearly more comfortable with the car. I mean, regardless of the pace of the car, we know we’re missing downforce. We know we’re struggling with balance issues – this is clear. But he’s doing a better job in managing it, so I have to get to that level.
“For me, it is just a pure feel and confidence thing with the car. It’s not a driving style – [that] I’m braking too late, not carrying enough mid speed, this and that. If you don’t feel the confidence in the car, you can’t begin to work on the more technical aspects when you eventually, will have to work on those things.”
Monaco double DNF a “bitter day” for Porsche
Porsche Formula E director Florian Modlinger said Porsche’s double retirement in the Monaco EPrix marked a “bitter day” for the team.
Pascal Wehrlein had been leading the race until he suddenly lost power to the car, with his team unable to radio to their driver. After a Safety Car, Andre Lotterer’s race ended in the Sainte Devote barriers following contact with Oliver Rowland.
“This is a bitter day for the team,” said Modlinger. “After a very good first half, Pascal was leading the field only to have a technical defect throw him out of contention. We now have to analyse what happened.
“The drivers and the team put in a strong qualifying performance and a promising start to the race, but unfortunately weren’t rewarded in the end.”
IndyCar drivers excited for Miami Grand Prix
IndyCar drivers Alexander Rossi, Colton Herta and Callum Ilott all say they are excited for Formula 1’s first ever Miami Grand Prix next weekend.
“I think it’s going to be awesome,” said Rossi. “I’m just excited for Formula 1 and America, honestly. It’s been a long time coming to have multiple races in the States. It’s a big country. There’s no reason not to have three. 
Herta said that it was “really good” to see Formula 1 growing in the USA, while Ilott thinks the event will draw a large crowd despite the high ticket prices.
“With the amount of people that turned up to COTA last year, I think Miami will be quite a spectacle and a half, even aside from the on-track stuff,” said Ilott. “I have no idea where the track goes. The rest of it should be a great venue for a lot of people. Just expensive.”

Comment of the day
After this week’s poll asked whether F1 should adopt IndyCar’s approach to red flags in qualifying, a typically insightful contribution from @gt-racer…

This is actually something F1 has looked at adopting in the past but which they ultimately feel there is no real need for as the belief is they have enough data & analysis tools available to them now (As well as what teams are able to do to compile & present additional data) that it’s easy to see when something is done intentionally and when it was a simple mistake.
Indycar feel the need to have the lap time deletion as they don’t have access to the same amount of data or have the same sort of analysis tools available to them (Or the teams) so it’s much more difficult to judge if certain things were intentional or not.
It’s something they have had since the 90’s in different forms & something that was introduced at a time when they didn’t always have TV coverage of qualifying, Didn’t have much data from the cars and where only a few cars carried onboard cameras. Back then judging incidents in qualifying was next to impossible so this came about as a deterrent. As coverage of qualifying & data available has got to where it is now, It’s probably something they wouldn’t introduce if it wasn’t already a thing as it’s less needed than it once was.

VeeKay started the day off with the fastest time in the second practice session. After advancing through rounds one and two, VeeKay leapt over defending race winner Álex Palou to claim his first pole in over a year, setting a fastest lap of 1’06.251 around the 3.8 kilometre circuit.
Despite a small mistake at the start of his final flying lap, McLaren SP driver Pato O’Ward still went quick enough to qualify second, sharing the front row with VeeKay. Palou will start third as he looks for his first win of the year – from the same position that he won from last year at this venue, no less – next to St. Petersburg GP winner Scott McLaughlin in fourth.
Alexander Rossi was unsure if he’d even be able to run in qualifying after a crash in second practice, but he made it all the way into Fast Six qualifying and will start fifth, next to Felix Rosenqvist in sixth.
Newgarden, the points leader and a three-time winner at Barber Motorsports Park, will start seventh next to Romain Grosjean in eighth, Graham Rahal in ninth, and Colton Herta – the fastest driver in Friday’s first practice session – in tenth.
Callum Ilott and Juncos Hollinger Racing advanced to the second round of qualifying for the first time; Ilott will start eleventh as the top rookie, ahead of Marcus Ericsson, who spun off into the gravel at turn nine at the end of round two qualifying, and brought out a red flag as the timer hit zero, resulting in the deletion of his fastest lap.
Further back in the field, Scott Dixon will start 13th as he vies for his first win at the circuit, and Will Power, a four-time pole winner at Barber, starts down in 19th place.
Sunday’s Grand Prix of Alabama will run over 90 laps. The green flag will fly at 6.15pm UK time.

Vandoorne rose from fourth on the grid to take the lead of the race, using his strong clean air pace to his advantage after Pascal Wehrlein retired from the front of the field with a mechanical problem.
The Mercedes pulled away out of the reach of Evans who used Attack Mode to try and chase down Vandoorne in the final laps. Jean-Eric Vergne claimed third place for Techeetah.
At the start, polesitter Mitch Evans led away ahead of Pascal Wherlein in second, with Jean-Eric Vergne behind them in third as the field made their way around the Monte Carlo streets for the first time. Sam Bird lost seven places at the start, while Jake Dennis managed to gain three.
The field ran in an relatively orderly fashion over the opening ten minutes, with only Nick Cassidy stepping out of the large queue to be the first driver to take attack mode from near the back of the field.
Antonio Felix da Costa took his first attack mode from 11th place, using it to pass Oliver Rowland and Jake Dennis once they took attack mode the following lap. Further back, Bird retired from the race after reporting wishbone damage on his Jaguar.
Back out front, Evans was still leading, but Wehrlein starting pressuring the leader, trying a half-hearted look to the outside into the harbour chicane. Evans was able to fend him off and retain the lead.
Vergne was the first of the leaders to take attack mode, dropping from third to sixth behind Lucas di Grassi and Robin Frijns. Vergne charged past Frijns into fifth up the hill after Sainte Devote, before passing Di Grassi for fourth at the chicane half a lap later.
Evans eventually took his first attack mode just before half distance, gifting the lead to Wehrlein dropping behind Vergne in third, as Stoffel Vandoorne and Di Grassi did the same. A lap later, Wehrlein took his first attack mode, only just falling behind Evans in third and allowing Vergne into the lead.
Despite both Evans and Wehrlein having the benefit of attack mode, the Porsche passed the Jaguar to move up into second place and immediately began pressuring Vergne for the lead. Coming out of the tunnel, Wehrlein used his extra speed to drive around Vergne into the lead of the race, while Vandoorne demoted Evans down to fourth.
Suddenly, Wehrlein began slowing approaching the Fairmont Hotel Hairpin, pulling to the side of the track as Vergne took the lead of the race. Vergne took his second attack mode on the following lap, allowing Vandoorne into first position. But Wehrlein had come to a stop at the exit of the tunnel, causing a brief Full Course Yellow while the Porsche was recovered.
After the session restarted, Oliver Rowland and Andre Lotterer collided while fighting into Sainte Devote, with both cars clattering into the barriers, putting Lotterer out on the sport and forcing Rowland to pull off the circuit further around the lap. The Safety Car was deployed, but Vandoorne took his second attack mode and managed to retain the lead of the race, his attack mode time draining away as he sat behind the Safety Car.
The race restarted with under ten minutes of regulation race time remaining, with Vandoorne leading Evans and Vergne. Evans was the only driver in the top four positions yet to take his second attack mode. He eventually did with just over five minutes of standard race time remaining, dropping to fourth behind Frijns.
Evans used his greater power to first drive around Frijns into fourth, before doing the same to Vergne for second a lap later. The Jaguar driver had only a minute of attack mode remaining to try and catch Vandoorne in the lead, but was unable to bridge the gap to the Mercedes out front.
Vandoorne managed to hold his advantage and use up the additional race time to cross the line with less than one percent of energy remaining and take the chequered flag, a handful of seconds ahead of Mitch Evans. The Mercedes driver also secured the championship lead with his victory.
Jean-Eric Vergne took the final place on the famous Monaco podium in third, ahead of Robin Frijns in fourth. Da Costa took fifth for Techeetah, with Di Grassi in sixth for local team Venturi. Nick Cassidy took seventh for Envision, with Sebastian Buemi moving up from the rear of the grid to finish in eighth.
Jake Dennis and Nyck de Vries rounded out the points positions in ninth and tenth, respectively.

Have your say.,"Last weekend’s Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix was the first sprint weekend of the 2022 Formula 1 season, seeing qualifying take place on Friday evening rather than the traditional Saturday.

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




In a qualifying session affected by rain across all three stages, the red flags were shown on a record five separate occasions – the most ever in a single three stage qualifying session since the format was introduced back in 2006.
However, rather than those responsible for triggering the red flag stoppages having their qualifying ruined by being the cause of a red flag, multiple drivers appeared to benefit from halting the session due to their own mistakes.
Carlos Sainz Jnr’s crash at the second Rivazza in Q2 may have put a stop to his qualifying, but it also effectively ended the entire second segment of the session as the rain began to fall during the subsequent red flag period that followed. With Sainz sitting second in the times when he spun, he effectively guaranteed his progression into Q3 and a starting position for the sprint race of at least tenth, while dooming those outside the top ten at the time to be eliminated.
In Q3, Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc were in the middle of what should have been their first timed laps of the final session when Kevin Magnussen slid off the track at Acque Minerali, causing the session to be stopped. However, Magnussen managed to avoid being beached in the gravel and pulled his car onto an access road at the end of the gravel trap, turning his car around before returning safely to the pits under the red flag. He would eventually rejoin the session and qualify fourth.
Magnussen took fourth in Imola qualifying despite causing a red flagIn the closing minutes of Q3 after another red flag for Valtteri Bottas stopping on circuit with an exhaust problem, Lando Norris spun on his out lap at the same part of Acque Minerali that Magnussen had spun earlier, prompting the fifth and final red flag that effectively ended qualifying. But with Norris in a provisional third place before the session had been restarted, his error meant he had effectively secured himself third on the grid for the sprint race.
The results of the heavily disrupted session led to heavy discussion among fans on social media, with many arguing that there should be penalties to prevent drivers from causing red flags in qualifying without any disadvantage, when the laps of all other drivers on the circuit are affected by them.
The example of Charles Leclerc taking pole position for his home grand prix in Monaco in 2021 after crashing at the exit of the Swimming Pool also stands out as a case of a driver’s mistake actually benefiting them by denying their rivals a chance to beat their previous times.
In IndyCar, however, a very different approach is taken to red flags that occur during qualifying compared to that used in Formula 1.
In the 2022 IndyCar Series rulebook, rule 8.3.4 states that “if a car causes a Red Condition [red flag] in any segment, the car’s best two timed laps of the segment shall be disallowed.” The rule also states that a driver who causes a red flag in a qualifying session cannot continue in the session and also may not be allowed to advance to the next stage of qualifying should their times be fast enough after their best two times are deleted.
So should Formula 1 consider emulating IndyCar in its approach to red flags in qualifying by deleting the two best lap times of drivers responsible for sessions being suspended?


For
The Norris incident at the end of Q3 in Imola is possibly the greatest example that could be used to argue for the introduction. By bringing out a red flag by spinning on his out lap, Norris prevented any of his rivals from being able to improve their times at the end of Q3 – not only denying Charles Leclerc an opportunity to challenge for pole position, but preventing anyone from taking his third position away.
Drivers in Formula 1 should not be rewarded for mistakes – especially not during the ultimate test of speed that is qualifying. By deleting the two best lap times for any driver deemed responsible for causing a red flag in a qualifying session, F1 would help to ensure that there are no ways to benefit from making a major mistake, or, even worse, exploiting the rules by deliberately trying to create a stoppage.


Against
The most important thing about red flags in any session is safety. A red flag should be called to ensure that any hazard on the race track can be dealt with promptly and safely without asking marshals to go out onto a live race track during the point where drivers will be at their fastest all weekend. If a driver is able to get going again after a spin or crash and rejoin a session, they should not be prevented from doing so as that in itself is an achievement.
There’s also the fact that in qualifying, drivers get 18, 15 and then 12 minutes in which to secure their place in the next session and their grid position. If a driver causes a red flag in the final moments of a session and prevents rivals from beating them, they likely had plenty of time prior to the stoppage to have set the quickest lap time they could instead of at the very end of a session.


I say

What seems to be a very easy and simple solution to a problem perhaps needs a bit more thought before it’s applied to Formula 1.
While cancelling lap times of drivers who cause red flags with ensure no one who crashes in qualifying will benefit from it, it also does not provide drivers who have had to abandon laps due to red flags with their laps back or with the session time lost as a result.
There’s also the question of whether the risk of losing two best lap times in a session will be too much of a deterrent in qualifying – especially with all the barrier-lined street circuits on the current calendar. Will drivers truly give 100% in those last-gasp Q3 laps in places like Monaco or Baku, where just a slight misjudgement can see them into the barriers and losing not just a chance at pole position, but their two best times too?
There’s certainly an argument to make that by taking away drivers’ best laps when they cause red flags, any risk of drivers trying to manipulate results in their favour by causing any deliberate hazards on the track.
Finally, there’s also the possibility that a driver will lose a well-earned position in qualifying due to a mechanical problem with their car causing a red flag through not fault of the driver – such as Alex Albon’s exploding brakes in Imola.
There is definitely a discussion to be had about preventing drivers from crashing their way to success in qualifying, but maybe a compromise solution would be better than adopting the current IndyCar rule like-for-like.

Sainz apology important to ‘clean the slate’ says Ricciardo

Daniel Ricciardo says it was important for him to apologise to Carlos Sainz Jnr after their lap one clash at Imola and ‘clean the slate’ with the Ferrari driver.
The pair collided at the first turn in the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, knocking Sainz out of the race and leaving Ricciardo with diffuser damage that hampered him the entire race. After the race, Ricciardo visited the Ferrari hospitality suite to apologise in person to Sainz for the contact.
Speaking on an appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Ricciardo said it was important for him to make sure there would be no hard feelings between the pair moving forward through the rest of the season.
“I hated every second of the apology!,” Ricciardo told host Trevor Noah. “I guess probably with experience, being in it for so long, I have the maturity, I guess, to know now how much we all put into it. And as competitive as we are, we all have something strongly in common.
“There’s only 20 of us who do it – there’s only 20 F1 drivers. You kind of just respect everyone’s journey. Like the incident – if I hold myself accountable, I feel like I want to just apologise. It’s nothing personal. I don’t think everyone would do it, but for me, I just felt better by doing it.

McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl says the team have now established what the main strengths and weaknesses of their car are after the opening four races of the 2022 season.
The team enjoyed their first podium finish of the season in Imola after a tough start to the season in Bahrain that saw them finish outside of the top ten. Seidl says that McLaren now have a “clear idea” of where the MCL36’s strengths are.
“Definitely we improved our understanding of the car over the last couple of weekends after we had to play catch up with missing out on all these laps at the test in Bahrain,” said Seidl. 
“I guess we have a clear idea on the strengths and weaknesses of our car. I have a clear idea of what we have to address in order to bring more performance to the car. We have a clear plan in place of how we’re going to do at. We have to manage a lot of parameters, like cost cap as well, reduced wind tunnel time, etc, etc, but I’m very happy with what I’m seeing the team is doing and how the team is attacking that challenge.”
Drive to Survive style TV show would be “amazing” for IndyCar – Palou
McLaren SP driver Alex Palou believes that a Drive to Survive style documentary series would help to promote the popularity of IndyCar.
The success of the Netflix-produced show has been credited with the growth of Formula 1’s popularity in recent years. Palou thinks it would be “amazing” to have an equivalent show for IndyCar
“I think everybody saw what the Drive to Survive did to the series, and especially to the drivers and people working there,” said Palou.
“They told a story that maybe for really every motorsports enthusiastic kind of person that are following every session that you know that it’s a bit too dramatic, but it works for normal people and new fans, which that’s what they want and that’s what we want, as well. So yeah, absolutely. I think it would be amazing to have something close to that.”
McLaren “investigating” Hamilton abuse comments on Twitter
McLaren says it is “investigating” abusive comments about Lewis Hamilton allegedly made by an employee of the company on Twitter. “We consider these comments to be completely at odds with our values and culture at McLaren. We take the matter extremely seriously and are investigating it as a priority,” it said in a statement.

Comment of the day
After Pierre Gasly exclusively told RaceFans that he feels he deserves to be racing alongside the likes of Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc and Lando Norris, @geemac says it’s never a case of drivers getting opportunities because they deserve them… 
Gasly is a top quality Grand Prix driver and my respect for him went through the roof when I read his great article in the Player’s Tribune. He is still in F1 and has a decent car at his disposal. He is a Grand Prix winner. Even if his career ended tomorrow he would go down as a far better driver than the overwhelming majority of those who have started a world championship Grand Prix. But he does not “deserve” anything. He needs to continue to claw away and fight for everything he can get. If the cards fall his way, he has everything he needs to grab any opportunity with both hands.

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




The change to next year’s rules is detailed in updated sporting regulations for the current season issued by the FIA.
The F1 Commission agreed earlier this week to trial a reduction in the total number of tyre sets permitted for a race weekend from 13 to 11. This will take place at two races next year where a ‘Revised Qualifying Format’ is to be used.
Drivers will receive half as many soft compound tyres for these events as usual – four instead of eight. The allocations of medium and hard tyres will increase by one each, to four and three respectively. In a further change, drivers will be required to use one of each of these compounds during the regular, three-stage qualifying session.
Each driver will only be permitted to run on the hardest compound of dry tyres in Q1. The medium compound will be mandatory in Q2 and those who reach Q3 may only use the soft tyres.
In a statement released after the F1 Commission meeting on Tuesday, the FIA noted that a test run of reduced tyre compounds at two race weekends in the 2023 season would be carried out “to evaluate the impact of the reduction in tyre allocation on track-running, with the overall intention to move to more sustainable use of tyres in the future.”
Rules changes approved for this year include scrapping the maximum number of tyre testing days of 30 permitted in the season, as well as clarifications over the use of so-called ‘mule cars’ and what the FIA will recognise as ‘genuine car damage’ sustained in incidents for rules purposes.
The Commission also discussed expanding the number of sprint races to six next year, but the FIA is yet to grant its approval for the change. The first edition of the 2023 F1 sporting regulations has yet to be published.

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




Sitting in the AlphaTauri hospitality suite in a bustling Imola paddock, the one-time grand prix winner has to take a moment to work out that he’s now in the midst of his fifth full F1 campaign – and fourth with the Faenza-based team.
Contracted until the end of the 2023 season, Gasly is on course to beat Daniil Kvyat’s record of most race starts with the Red Bull junior squad, formerly known as Toro Rosso.
But as the news Carlos Sainz Jnr (another product of Red Bull’s young driver programme) has signed a contract extension with Ferrari breaks shortly before RaceFans’ exclusive interview with Gasly begins, talk inevitably turns to his own future.
“So this is my fifth year in Formula 1,” Gasly says, after taking a second to count the years since his late-2017 debut.
Red Bull brought Gasly into F1 in 2017“I am doing all that because I want to fight at the front. It’s why I’m waking up every day, why I’m training every single day. Why I’m looking after my nutrition, my sleep, my recovery. Every single detail is because I want to fight with the best drivers at the top.”
The last 12 months have been lucrative for Formula 1’s golden generation of exceptionally talented under-25s. Max Verstappen capped off a world championship title by signing a monster six-year extension, Lando Norris committed his future to McLaren at the start of the season and George Russell’s Mercedes dream has finally manifested after three seasons spent toiling away at the back of the grid.
As happy for his peers as Gasly has been, the 26-year-old admits he feels he deserves to be mixing it with that formidable company out on the track every race weekend.
Advert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free




“I see Charles in a Ferrari, I see Max in the Red Bull, George in the Mercedes, Lando in the McLaren – I’ve been fighting with these guys all my career,” Gasly says. “I know that’s where I belong and I want to get my chance to be in this position as well.”
However this isn’t an unfamiliar position for Gasly – quite the opposite. Back in 2019, the then 22-year-old was handed the opportunity of a lifetime to move into the Red Bull senior team alongside Verstappen as Daniel Ricciardo’s Red Bull replacement. But half a season later, a points deficit of 118 to the future world champion led to his brutal demotion back to Italy, where he has remained ever since.
Gasly has visited the scene of Hubert’s fatal crash every year sinceWhat followed were the three most rewarding, yet challenging, seasons in his racing career. From the highs of his Monza win and his unexpected podiums to the crushing disappointment of losing one of the best seats in motorsport and the more devastating loss of his good friend Anthoine Hubert, Gasly has been admirably honest about his emotions over the last few years.
One year ago Gasly wrote a one-off piece offering a refreshingly frank insight into the emotional toll and pressure of being a modern Formula 1 driver, especially when grieving. Gasly says that he is not one to shy away from expressing his emotions.
“I’m someone who is very honest. I have nothing to hide,” Gasly says. “I think it’s fine that things should be spoken out, sometimes.
“There are things which have to stay confidential – especially as a professional, I’ve never released confidential details – but I was in a moment where there was obviously the loss of Anthoine which was really heavy to go through and to process. The change of team at the same time. There were a lot of things which were said which were not true or not with the right information.
“For me, I just felt ‘okay, this is also me. This is Pierre Gasly, this is how I am, this is how I feel’. We’re all human. We can be athletes – we are seen as athletes – but at the end, there is a human behind every driver. There is hurt. Emotions. Mentality. It just felt for me that it was important to kind of move on from this negative spiral which I had for these first six months. It was just something important to myself. And obviously by far the most challenging time I’ve ever had to face as a driver.”

Rather than wilt, Gasly met disappointment with determination. Facing all his F1 dreams disappearing in front of him, Gasly kept his chin up and got his head down.
“Growing up, I always believed in hard work and discipline and believing in that process – that as long as you keep doing the right things, the right outcome will happen at the end,” he explains.
A brief stint alongside Verstappen did not end well“And that’s the mentality I went through all these years. I mean, at this stage of my career, these are the cards that I have in my hand. How do I play best with what I have in my hand? Whether it’s the best cards or not, doesn’t matter. This is my game and I got to make it work with these cards.
“At the end of the day, work doesn’t lie. Here, we all talented. Everyone that is in this paddock is special. All brilliant drivers. Some a bit more exceptional than others, but at the end of the day, we all are super talented. And to make the difference, you’ve got to work on the small details that will bring you the X-factor compared to others.”
Still very much a part of the Red Bull ecosystem, Gasly has only strengthened his case for a second shot at the factory seat now occupied by Sergio Perez since returning to AlphaTauri – especially after claiming a stunning victory in Monza in 2020 and his regular top five qualifying results in 2021. Although he admits his admiration for the job Perez has been doing at Red Bull in 2022, Gasly says his sights are still set on reclaiming what was once his.
“I feel ready,” he says. “I felt like I’ve shown my potential. I’ve shown that I’m able to deliver once I get the tools that I need in my hands to do it.
“But then after, I also understand them. It’s their decision – I’m fine with that. I think what’s important is that, at the end of the day, when you work with a team – a team works with a driver or a driver works with a team – there needs to be that common will and desire to do it together. Whatever it takes. There needs to be the will to do things together, to have the same target in mind.”
While he offers no excuses for the performance gap between himself and Verstappen over those early months of 2019, Gasly believes his abilities are so far beyond those he possessed three years ago that he is practically a different driver.
Monza 2020 is a career high Gasly is keen to repeat“The driver I am today is way better than the driver I was after one year,” he insists. “If they saw at the time I was the right fit for the team after such a short time, then now there are even more reasons to think I’m prepared to get that seat.”
Watching drivers younger than him secure long contracts that should keep them at the front of the field contending for podiums, wins and even championships, it would be easy for Gasly to become frustrated or even disillusioned with Red Bull. However, he says he values still being a part of Red Bull’s programme and will wait for his opportunity, even while he sits on the cusp of a fifth full season with AlphaTauri in 2023.
“I think I’ve always said, at the moment, my priority is to discuss with [Red Bull] and they will always have the priority over others,” he says. “Because I’m very grateful for everything they’ve done in my career and that I’m aware that I’d never be here without the support of Helmut and Red Bull over these past years.
“I’ve told [Helmut] last time that actually this is the longest relationship I’ve ever had in my life, you know? Nine years with Red Bull. It’s been eight-and-a-half years of success, fighting for all the best positions, having a very, very successful ride together. There were the six months that didn’t work out for the reasons that we know.”
Compared to the consistent high performance Gasly and his team enjoyed last season, 2022 has not started quite as successfully as either he or the factory would have wanted. At the time of our chat Gasly lies 12th in the championship. Although he echoes the thoughts of many of his fellow drivers that the new technical regulations for 2022 have achieved their goal of improving racing, Gasly says he’s not entirely satisfied with the impact the new rules have had so far.
Gasly hoped midfield would be more competitive this year“From a racing point of view, I must say it’s been more fun,” he explains. “I think we did achieve some of the targets which were made with the regulation changes. Is it as good as we would have liked? As long as it’s better, for me, I’m not going to complain. It has had a positive impact on the racing, which is most important. More overtaking, being able to follow more closely.
“The only thing is, I wished that the whole field was closer than it is. I was really hoping, ‘okay, we can see more midfield cars getting closer to the podium positions’. And in the end, last year I had more chances to be in the top five than I have this season. So on that side, it was the only little setback, seeing at the start of the year that Ferrari is on a league of their own, Red Bull sort of managed to get there as well. And then after, there is not like a small gap – it’s like a pretty big world to catch up with these guys. So this is the only downside.
“But I think it was more like dreaming this is achievable when we know in motorsport, every time you’ve got a regulation change. Mercedes got the best of it the last eight years, now Ferrari seems to get it right and slowly I think we’re going to catch up, but it’s probably going to take time.”
With his place at AlphaTauri and in Formula 1 secured until at least the end of next season, Gasly at least knows he has some time ahead to try and help build his team back up to the level of performance they enjoyed last year. But he is also confident he will get an opportunity to make his case for a return to Milton Keynes at some point in the future.
“This is a conversation we need to have that we didn’t have yet,” he says. “Right now, I probably think it might be too early, because it’s also only 2022 and the focus is on making the best season possible with AlphaTauri.
“But I’m sure there are going to be conversations and see what’s good. I know they are happy with the way it works for them at the moment and that also works for me. Checo is doing very good there, so it makes sense. But then, at the end of the day, I also need to look at my own career and what’s best for me, what will give me the most chances to achieve my personal goals, which is to be a world champion over the next few years.”

That’s the view of the FIA’s head of aerodynamics Jason Somerville. He joined the sport’s governing body earlier this year, having spent five years at Formula 1 where he developed the new technical rules which were introduced this year.
DRS was introduced to F1 in 2011 to help drivers make overtaking moves. The new rules developed for this season were also designed to address that problem, but Somerville said it became clear during their development that F1 wouldn’t be able to do away with DRS immediately after their introduction.
“During the initial research, because we reduced the size of the ‘hole’ that sits behind the car, we reduced the downforce lost [by a following car] but we also reduced the tow,” he explained in an interview with Peter Windsor. “So we were a bit mindful that we probably weren’t going to be able to just park DRS and remove it from the regulations.”
However he indicated F1’s reliance on DRS to aid passes could be reduced and eventually removed. “I think DRS, for us, is a very tune-able feature,” he said. “It’s very circuit-dependent and it can be dialled in and out.
“I think most of us feel, longer-term, we’d very much like to try and phase DRS out if we can. But we didn’t think that was necessarily going to be the right thing to do overnight for these regulations.”
Formula 1 will introduce its next major revision of the technical regulations in four years’ time. “For the 2026 car, we’re looking at different solutions,” said Somerville. “And it may be that DRS doesn’t have to have such an important role in the concept of those cars.”
Advert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free




During and after the last race at Imola, several drivers claimed DRS should have been activated earlier than it was to aid overtaking. However Somerville pointed out passes were made without DRS before then and few were afterwards.
“I thought it was quite interesting that because we had this drying track, we had almost half the racing with no DRS. And I think it was interesting to see that there were a few overtakes that happened before the DRS got switched on but then the DRS was cancelling each other out.”
Somerville believes F1’s four grands prix so far this year have shown the new rules have helped drivers race more closely. This will inform F1’s thinking on “how we prioritise DRS at the various events” in future.
“At the start we couldn’t be 100% sure that the teams wouldn’t have undone half of the work that we’d spent the last four years doing,” he said. “Now it looks like we’ve managed to keep a lot of it so that has meant the teams can visibly run a lot closer through the corners and onto the next straight.
“So we do get something that we haven’t seen for a while, actually, an overtake happens but you look over your shoulder and he’s still there and he comes back at you. That’s something that has been quite refreshing for the first few races at various points and it’s not purely been DRS. There’s been DRS ‘cat and mouse’ but I think we’ve been quite pleased that the downforce retention is there.
“We just need to be careful that we don’t ignore the fact that naturally means the tow is a bit smaller. So you kind of need the tow effect, the big hole in the air behind you, to give you a little bit of a boost if you haven’t got DRS.”

“Real star” Hamilton will fight back – Wolff

Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free




After Hamilton struggled to a point-less 13th in Imola, Wolff said: “It’s not his low, I think it’s the low of the car performance.”
He is certain Hamilton, who narrowly missed out on winning a record eighth world championship last year, will be back in competitive shape once the team makes some progress with his car.
“We know that he’s a seven-time world champion,” said Wolff. “He caught up last year, him and us at the team, we caught it up and fought for the championship [after] it was lost actually Saturday of Brazil. So the guy is the best driver in the world and he’s just not having a machine and equipment underneath him and to be able to execute.”
Wolff said other great drivers in F1 history have recovered from difficult spells. “The real stars, they have recovered. There is none out of the really great ones that come into my mind that didn’t have certain moments in their careers where things didn’t run properly. And that is the case now with him since a long time. 
“He’s going to help the team to sort itself out and we are sticking together through good and bad times.”
Gen3 car justifies why Jaguar joined Formula E – Barclay
Jaguar Formula E team principal James Barclay says that the newly unveiled Gen3 car has the ‘correct ingredients’ for the future of the electric series.
Being introduced from the 2023 season, the new Gen3 car is lighter and more powerful than the current-spec of Formula E car. Barclay says that the new model has the ‘correct ingredients’ for the future.
“At the heart of it, what justifies why we came into this sport, what continues to justify why we wanted to commit to the future, is the core ingredients are absolutely correct for the future,” said Barclay.
“The fact is we’re the pinnacle of all-electric racing. And there’ll be other categories come the future, but Formula E is the pinnacle of electric racing. That is really kind of fundamental to the heart of it, because Jaguar as a brand from 2025, becomes all-electric model luxury brand.”

Andretti, Fittipaldi, Montoya named Miami Grand Prix ‘ambassadors’
Three former grand prix winners from North and South America have been named as ambassadors for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix next weekend.
Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi and Juan Pablo Montoya will be ambassadors for the event, held around the Miami International Autodrome, circling the Hard Rock Stadium home of the Miami Dolphins NFL team.
“Having lived in this part of the world for a long time, I’m very excited that we will be able to showcase all that Miami and South Florida has to offer,” said Montoya.
“It’s an attractive place, so equally for Formula 1 to come here and bring the glamour, technology and exciting racing will mean the Miami Grand Prix will be a truly unforgettable experience.”

F1's radical new 2026 car: active aero, smaller cars and auto crash prevention (Motor Sport)Pat Symonds: ""So it’s all about active aero – having two modes to the car effectively. So rather different to DRS, there’s a mode where the car has high downforce and consequently high drag when it’s in the corner, and a mode where it has low drag when it’s on the straight and consequently low downforce.""

Comment of the day
After Carlos Sainz Jnr’s frustrating start to the season, reader Gusmaia thinks that the newly re-signed Ferrari driver is about to enter a critical phase of his tenure with the team…
In fact, Sainz does not need confidence. He needs a load of points and even some wins from here to Monaco. Otherwise, Ferrari will be totally justified to concentrate on Leclerc. The team really likes to push for a #1 driver. If only one driver has the luck/talent to win and to beat Redbull, then Sainz will have to accept a #2 role. Plus, is 2023 starts with Leclerc World Champion, the rest of his Carlos contract wil be like that.
