2,In the round up Alfa Romeo expecting to be strong in Miami IndyCar needs more buzz says Rossi Evans lucky to finish second in Monaco,In the round up Alfa Romeo s Xevi Pujolar believes the Miami

head of trackside engineering Xevi Pujolar predicts that the Miami Grand Prix circuit will suit their car s strengths next weekend The team currently sit fifth in the constructors championship having acquired points over the first four rounds Pujolar believes that the Miami circuit will suit the car better than Imola where Valtteri Bottas scored their best result of the season so far with fifth We expect to be stronger than in Imola Pujolar said I think the type of layout could maybe suit us a bit better Now we ve got an idea we ve got a layout in the simulator and everything but how actually it will look we ll have to find out when we are there So we ll see It s kind of a layout that I think we will be strong but we ll have to see in terms of the tarmac and everything what actually what it will be But everyone has a lot of expectation and for us now with the package and everything fighting with Alpine and McLaren is very encouraging for us IndyCar lacking buzz around racing Rossi Alexander Rossi says IndyCar would benefit from creating more buzz around itself Speaking ahead of yesterday s Grand Prix of Alabama at Barber Rossi praised the quality of racing in IndyCar but said the series needs to create greater excitement around itself away from the track I think we all have to remember we are an entertainment property ultimately said Rossi That is what we are That s why we always talk about the show That s why we re always interested in improving that with car updates It s talks and conversations we always have I think IndyCar is aware of that I think the on track product is not necessarily the issue right It s creating that buzz around it that we lack that we struggle in I think that takes someone much smarter than me to figure out Evans lucky to take second after energy issues in Monaco Mitch Evans says he and his Jaguar team were lucky to finish second in the Monaco EPrix after he had to carry out more energy saving than he anticipated in the race Evans had started from pole position and lead the early laps until he had to back off to conserve energy The Jaguar driver admits he got a bit of a shock after the team had figured out his energy level We had a clear strategy and obviously got the lead at the start Evans explained For the first few laps I was under consuming Everything for our plan was looking strong until we got the energies and got a bit of a shock when I when I heard I was down on energy It was quite stressful and I think we recovered really well I think to get second today we were very lucky We ll analyse things obviously

4,Milestone have just secured the Moto GP game license until so how does the latest edition of the official Moto GP game hold up ,The Moto GP season has only just reached Jerez for the first of its many rounds held in Spain and already fans of the series can enjoy the official Moto GP game on almost all the most popular formats Advert Become a Supporter go ad free Over the years the Milestone developed official Moto GP game series has steadily grown into perhaps the most underrated major licenced racing franchise on the market Of course hardcore Moto GP fans will have plenty of gripes about the series and some of the minutiae of the gameplay but from the accessibility for newcomers the depth of challenge offered by the handling model and the volume of content available the Moto GP license has never been in better hands than with Milestone Just days ago the series announced Milestone would continue to hold exclusive licencing rights for Moto GP games until So what s new with Moto GP the second edition of the game released on current generation hardware and is the investment in a brand new entry worth it for those who already own Moto GP All the Moto GP class teams and riders are presentFor a start it will come of little surprise to learn that Moto GP is another evolutionary step in the series and not a dramatic reinvention on a whole new game engine If you ve played any of the last few games you ll find plenty familiar in this latest version All the teams and riders from this Moto GP season are present including the new Indonesian Grand Prix circuit at Mandalika but in typical fashion the Moto and Moto classes have not yet been fully updated with all the rider liveries helmet designs and rider images As ever those will be added post launch in a free update On track Moto GP offers the same kind of deep and rewarding handling model it has offered over the last few years This is not an arcade game but an authentic light simulation game that can be surprisingly challenging to master if you ve never tried before These machines are savage especially in the premier class Asking too much of the bike at any point under braking throughout the corner on exit or by running onto the kerbs can unsettle the bike and cause it to completely lose contact with the road sending your rider hurtling through the air into the gravel Thankfully there are plenty of assists available to make things less of an ordeal but even with most of the riding assists enabled you should not expect to be able to jump onto Marc Marquez s Honda or Jack Miller s Ducati and start throwing yourself around the track Braking has been modified to try and offer a little more forgiveness than last year which could see the more powerful machines be very difficult to slow down effectively without riding aids A new suspension model can make the bikes more predictable over kerbs and rumble strips but do not confuse predictable to mean easier New for this year the adjustable ride height system allows you to optimise your drag on starts and out of corners with a touch of a button even being able to pre arm the system in a corner before it automatically activates on the straight Riding these bikes can be very challengingFor beginners the helpful tutorial mode from last year s game returns from teaching players all the basic and advanced mechanics in controlled tests For those who want a bit more practice there is now a new academy mode which functions almost identically to the circuit experience mode in Gran Turismo Breaking down each circuit into its sectors you can tackle each sector of a track at a time with bronze silver and gold target times to aim for It s supposed to help you learn the circuits and improve your knowledge of every section of every circuit However it s unlikely to really help those already experienced to learn anything new about their technique or help them improve their times New for this year is the so called Riding Analysis System which claims to help players improve their skills by offering feedback on their performance on track However this amounts to pop ups after races simply suggesting that you might want to check out the tyre management tutorial simply because your tyre wear was high in your last race hardly the most helpful of feedback systems At the heart of the game once again is the managerial career mode Remaining almost functionally identical to career mode allows you to create your rider and choose whether to start in Moto Moto or jump straight into the premier class As you progress you can create your own team and even start your own academy making decisions about hiring and firing staff on the way and setting development paths for your bike on the way It s certainly more detailed and deep an experience than many other racing games would provide but it s hard not to feel a sense of deja vu if you ve owned any of the previous two titles What Moto GP lacks compared to the current Formula series is a dynamic rider market and progression from junior categories for younger riders Without that it s hard to feel as invested long term as you progress through the seasons One welcome option this year however is the ability to choose shortened championship options with fewer races in a year A handy way to help enjoy the lower categories as you progress while helping to make sure the experience never feels dragged out if you lack the time to invest Nine Season guides players through the championshipHowever the career mode is not the major focus of this latest game Instead Moto GP s major headline feature is something no racing game has attempted to do before In the Nine Season mode Moto GP offers players a unique lookback at one of the most memorable seasons in Moto GP history Valentino Rossi s seventh and final top class title winning season Presented as a cinematic retelling of the championship featuring heavy use of archive footage and a documentary style narrator Nine Season breaks down every race of that year s championship into its key narratives and turns those into gameplay challenges for the player to complete as they navigate through the events of the season What could easily have been a half baked addition to the game for marketing purposes is actually executed with genuine brilliance It is clear how much effort and time has gone into the Nine Season mode with the quality of the cutscenes and the way real life footage blends almost seamlessly into the gameplay making it a truly impressive experience Even if you have no knowledge or little appreciation for the history of Moto GP the mode does an excellent job of setting the scene of each race and making you invested in the characters arguably more effectively that Moto GP s own Unlimited documentary series managed Hardcore fans of Rossi Casey Stoner Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedrosa will get the most enjoyment from reliving iconic moments through gameplay but it is still deeply rewarding to go through a specific period in racing history and relive it through gameplay It s wise to wait until you re more familiar with the game before jumping into Nine Season as you ll be thrown into racing scenarios and expected to catch rivals or pull gaps on bikes behind on circuits and bikes that you may be completely unfamiliar with But this is a far more meaty and substantial mode than what many could have expected and far more rewarding a journey to go through than say F s Braking Point mode As well as the Nine Season narrative mode Moto GP also includes every rider bike and circuit from the season to race with in any of the non career single player modes With many historic bikes and riders from previous games returning in this year s game there can be few complaints about the volume of content available in the game Customisation remains unchanged from As ever the customisation features from the previous few games return but it s still a little disappointing to have no freedom to completely design your bike livery from scratch la GT or Forza The game looks and sounds as pleasant as ever making impressive use of the Unreal engine with colourful bright image quality that the photo mode makes great use of The use of the old Dorna TV graphics package for the Nine Season mode is an especially nice touch while the menus and HUD feel slick and modern taking heavy inspiration from the sport s current visual branding The answer to the overall question of whether Moto GP is worth a full price purchase is as ever dependent on how much of a hardcore Moto GP fanatic you are But with all the content of small handling refinements and the addition of the super Nine Season mode to play through it s easy to recommend Moto GP to anyone interested in picking up a Moto GP game for the first time With Milestone owning the rights to the Moto GP licence for the next few years it will be exciting to see where this talented Italian development team take the series

so I have to get to that level For me it is just a pure feel and confidence thing with the car It s not a driving style that I m braking too late not carrying enough mid speed this and that If you don

should adopt IndyCar s approach to red flags in qualifying a typically insightful contribution from gt racer This is actually something F has looked at adopting in the past but which they ultimately feel there is no real need for as the belief is they have enough data analysis tools available to them now As well as what teams are able to do to compile present additional data that it s easy to see when something is done intentionally and when it was a simple mistake Indycar feel the need to have the lap time deletion as they don t have access to the same amount of data or have the same sort of analysis tools available to them Or the teams so it s much more difficult to judge if certain things were intentional or not It s something they have had since the s in different forms something that was introduced at a time when they didn t always have TV coverage of qualifying Didn t have much data from the cars and where only a few cars carried onboard cameras Back then judging incidents in qualifying was next to impossible so this came about as a deterrent As coverage of qualifying data available has got to where it is now It s probably something they wouldn t introduce if it wasn t already a thing as it s less needed than it once was gt racer Happy birthday Happy birthday to Ivan On this day in motorsport On this day in Emerson Fittipaldi won the Spanish Grand Prix at

to his advantage after Pascal Wehrlein retired from the front of the field with a mechanical problem The Mercedes pulled away out of the reach of Evans who used Attack Mode to try and chase down Vandoorne in the final laps Jean Eric Vergne claimed third place for Techeetah At the start polesitter Mitch Evans led away ahead of Pascal Wherlein in second with Jean Eric Vergne behind them in third as the field made their way around the Monte Carlo streets for the first time Sam Bird lost seven places at the start while Jake Dennis managed to gain three The field ran in an relatively orderly fashion over the opening ten minutes with only Nick Cassidy stepping out of the large queue to be the first driver to take attack mode from near the back of the field Antonio Felix da Costa took his first attack mode from th place using it to pass Oliver Rowland and Jake Dennis once they took attack mode the following lap Further back Bird retired from the race after reporting wishbone damage on his Jaguar Back out front Evans was still leading but Wehrlein starting pressuring the leader trying a half hearted look to the outside into the harbour chicane Evans was able to fend him off and retain the lead Vergne was the first of the leaders to take attack mode dropping from third to sixth behind Lucas di Grassi and Robin Frijns Vergne charged past Frijns into fifth up the hill after Sainte Devote before passing Di Grassi for fourth at the chicane half a lap later Evans eventually took his first attack mode just before half distance gifting the lead to Wehrlein dropping behind Vergne in third as Stoffel Vandoorne and Di Grassi did the same A lap later Wehrlein took his first attack mode only just falling behind Evans in third and allowing Vergne into the lead Despite both Evans and Wehrlein having the benefit of attack mode the Porsche passed the Jaguar to move up into second place and immediately began pressuring Vergne for the lead Coming out of the tunnel Wehrlein used his extra speed to drive around Vergne into the lead of the race while Vandoorne demoted Evans down to fourth Suddenly Wehrlein began slowing approaching the Fairmont Hotel Hairpin pulling to the side of the track as Vergne took the lead of the race Vergne took his second attack mode on the following lap allowing Vandoorne into first position But Wehrlein had come to a stop at the exit of the tunnel causing a brief Full Course Yellow while the Porsche was recovered After the session restarted Oliver Rowland and Andre Lotterer collided while fighting into Sainte Devote with both cars clattering into the barriers putting Lotterer out on the sport and forcing Rowland to pull off the circuit further around the lap The Safety Car was deployed but Vandoorne took his second attack mode and managed to retain the lead of the race his attack mode time draining away as he sat behind the Safety Car The race restarted with under ten minutes of regulation race time remaining with Vandoorne leading Evans and Vergne Evans was the only driver in the top four positions yet to take his second attack mode He eventually did with just over five minutes of standard race time remaining dropping to fourth behind Frijns Evans used his greater power to first drive around Frijns into fourth before doing the same to Vergne for second a lap later The Jaguar driver had only a minute of attack mode remaining to try and catch Vandoorne in the lead but was unable to bridge the gap to the Mercedes out front Vandoorne managed to hold his advantage and use up the additional race time to cross the line with less than one percent of energy remaining and take the chequered flag a handful of seconds ahead of Mitch Evans The Mercedes driver also secured the championship lead with his victory Jean Eric Vergne took the final place on the famous Monaco podium in third ahead of Robin Frijns in fourth Da Costa took fifth for Techeetah with Di Grassi in sixth for local team Venturi

8,Should Formula consider adopting IndyCar s rule of deleting the two best lap times of drivers who cause red flags in qualifying Have your say ,Last weekend s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix was the first sprint weekend of the Formula season seeing qualifying take place on Friday evening rather than the traditional Saturday Advert Become a Supporter go ad free In a qualifying session affected by rain across all three stages the red flags were shown on a record five separate occasions the most ever in a single three stage qualifying session since the format was introduced back in However rather than those responsible for triggering the red flag stoppages having their qualifying ruined by being the cause of a red flag multiple drivers appeared to benefit from halting the session due to their own mistakes Carlos Sainz Jnr s crash at the second Rivazza in Q may have put a stop to his qualifying but it also effectively ended the entire second segment of the session as the rain began to fall during the subsequent red flag period that followed With Sainz sitting second in the times when he spun he effectively guaranteed his progression into Q and a starting position for the sprint race of at least tenth while dooming those outside the top ten at the time to be eliminated In Q Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc were in the middle of what should have been their first timed laps of the final session when Kevin Magnussen slid off the track at Acque Minerali causing the session to be stopped However Magnussen managed to avoid being beached in the gravel and pulled his car onto an access road at the end of the gravel trap turning his car around before returning safely to the pits under the red flag He would eventually rejoin the session and qualify fourth Magnussen took fourth in Imola qualifying despite causing a red flagIn the closing minutes of Q after another red flag for Valtteri Bottas stopping on circuit with an exhaust problem Lando Norris spun on his out lap at the same part of Acque Minerali that Magnussen had spun earlier prompting the fifth and final red flag that effectively ended qualifying But with Norris in a provisional third place before the session had been restarted his error meant he had effectively secured himself third on the grid for the sprint race The results of the heavily disrupted session led to heavy discussion among fans on social media with many arguing that there should be penalties to prevent drivers from causing red flags in qualifying without any disadvantage when the laps of all other drivers on the circuit are affected by them The example of Charles Leclerc taking pole position for his home grand prix in Monaco in after crashing at the exit of the Swimming Pool also stands out as a case of a driver s mistake actually benefiting them by denying their rivals a chance to beat their previous times In IndyCar however a very different approach is taken to red flags that occur during qualifying compared to that used in Formula In the IndyCar Series rulebook rule states that if a car causes a Red Condition red flag in any segment the car s best two timed laps of the segment shall be disallowed The rule also states that a driver who causes a red flag in a qualifying session cannot continue in the session and also may not be allowed to advance to the next stage of qualifying should their times be fast enough after their best two times are deleted So should Formula consider emulating IndyCar in its approach to red flags in qualifying by deleting the two best lap times of drivers responsible for sessions being suspended For The Norris incident at the end of Q in Imola is possibly the greatest example that could be used to argue for the introduction By bringing out a red flag by spinning on his out lap Norris prevented any of his rivals from being able to improve their times at the end of Q not only denying Charles Leclerc an opportunity to challenge for pole position but preventing anyone from taking his third position away Drivers in Formula should not be rewarded for mistakes especially not during the ultimate test of speed that is qualifying By deleting the two best lap times for any driver deemed responsible for causing a red flag in a qualifying session F would help to ensure that there are no ways to benefit from making a major mistake or even worse exploiting the rules by deliberately trying to create a stoppage Against The most important thing about red flags in any session is safety A red flag should be called to ensure that any hazard on the race track can be dealt with promptly and safely without asking marshals to go out onto a live race track during the point where drivers will be at their fastest all weekend If a driver is able to get going again after a spin or crash and rejoin a session they should not be prevented from doing so as that in itself is an achievement There s also the fact that in qualifying drivers get and then minutes in which to secure their place in the next session and their grid position If a driver causes a red flag in the final moments of a session and prevents rivals from beating them they likely had plenty of time prior to the stoppage to have set the quickest lap time they could instead of at the very end of a session I say What seems to be a very easy and simple solution to a problem perhaps needs a bit more thought before it s applied to Formula While cancelling lap times of drivers who cause red flags with ensure no one who crashes in qualifying will benefit from it it also does not provide drivers who have had to abandon laps due to red flags with their laps back or with the session time lost as a result There s also the question of whether the risk of losing two best lap times in a session will be too much of a deterrent in qualifying especially with all the barrier lined street circuits on the current calendar Will drivers truly give in those last gasp Q laps in places like Monaco or Baku where just a slight misjudgement can see them into the barriers and losing not just a chance at pole position but their two best times too There s certainly an argument to make that by taking away drivers best laps when they cause red flags any risk of drivers trying to manipulate results in their favour by causing any deliberate hazards on the track Finally there s also the possibility that a driver will lose a well earned position in qualifying due to a mechanical problem with their car causing a red flag through not fault of the driver such as Alex Albon s exploding brakes in Imola There is definitely a discussion to be had about preventing drivers from crashing their way to success in qualifying but maybe a compromise solution would be better than adopting the current IndyCar rule

visited the Ferrari hospitality suite to apologise in person to Sainz for the contact Speaking on an appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Ricciardo said it was important for him to make sure there would be no hard feelings between the pair moving forward through the rest of the season I hated every second of the apology Ricciardo told host Trevor Noah I guess probably with experience

only F drivers You kind of just respect everyone s journey Like the incident if I hold myself accountable I feel like I want to just apologise It s nothing personal I don t think everyone would do it but for me I just felt better by doing it So we kind of just clean the slate for the next one and I know that when we come alongside each other on track next there s no intensity There ll be an intensity but nothing heightened I guess McLaren know the strengths and weaknesses of our car now Seidl McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl says the team have now established what the main strengths and weaknesses of their car are after the opening four races of the season The team enjoyed their first podium finish of the season in Imola after a tough start to the season in Bahrain that saw them finish outside of the top ten Seidl says that McLaren now have a clear idea of where the MCL s strengths are Definitely we improved our understanding of the car over the last couple of weekends after we had to play catch up with missing out on all these laps at the test in Bahrain said Seidl I guess we have a clear idea on the strengths and weaknesses of our car I have a clear idea of what we have to address in order to bring more performance to the car We have a clear plan in place of how we re going to do at We have to manage a lot of parameters like cost cap as well reduced wind tunnel time

people working there said Palou They told a story that maybe for really every motorsports enthusiastic kind of person that are following every session that you know that it s a bit too dramatic but it works for normal people and new fans which that s what they want and that s what we want as well So yeah absolutely I think it would be amazing to have something close to that McLaren investigating

12,Speaking exclusively to RaceFans Pierre Gasly explains how he s determined to earn a second shot in a Red Bull ,Pierre Gasly pauses as he tried to recall exactly how many seasons he s raced in Formula Advert Become a Supporter go ad free Sitting in the AlphaTauri hospitality suite in a bustling Imola paddock the one time grand prix winner has to take a moment to work out that he s now in the midst of his fifth full F campaign and fourth with the Faenza based team Contracted until the end of the season Gasly is on course to beat Daniil Kvyat s record of most race starts with the Red Bull junior squad formerly known as Toro Rosso But as the news Carlos Sainz Jnr another product of Red Bull s young driver programme has signed a contract extension with Ferrari breaks shortly before RaceFans exclusive interview with Gasly begins talk inevitably turns to his own future So this is my fifth year in Formula Gasly says after taking a second to count the years since his late debut Red Bull brought Gasly into F in I am doing all that because I want to fight at the front It s why I m waking up every day why I m training every single day Why I m looking after my nutrition my sleep my recovery Every single detail is because I want to fight with the best drivers at the top The last months have been lucrative for Formula s golden generation of exceptionally talented under s Max Verstappen capped off a world championship title by signing a monster six year extension Lando Norris committed his future to McLaren at the start of the season and George Russell s Mercedes dream has finally manifested after three seasons spent toiling away at the back of the grid As happy for his peers as Gasly has been the year old admits he feels he deserves to be mixing it with that formidable company out on the track every race weekend Advert Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad free I see Charles in a Ferrari I see Max in the Red Bull George in the Mercedes Lando in the McLaren I ve been fighting with these guys all my career Gasly says I know that s where I belong and I want to get my chance to be in this position as well However this isn t an unfamiliar position for Gasly quite the opposite Back in the then year old was handed the opportunity of a lifetime to move into the Red Bull senior team alongside Verstappen as Daniel Ricciardo s Red Bull replacement But half a season later a points deficit of to the future world champion led to his brutal demotion back to Italy where he has remained ever since Gasly has visited the scene of Hubert s fatal crash every year sinceWhat followed were the three most rewarding yet challenging seasons in his racing career From the highs of his Monza win and his unexpected podiums to the crushing disappointment of losing one of the best seats in motorsport and the more devastating loss of his good friend Anthoine Hubert Gasly has been admirably honest about his emotions over the last few years One year ago Gasly wrote a one off piece offering a refreshingly frank insight into the emotional toll and pressure of being a modern Formula driver especially when grieving Gasly says that he is not one to shy away from expressing his emotions I m someone who is very honest I have nothing to hide Gasly says I think it s fine that things should be spoken out sometimes There are things which have to stay confidential especially as a professional I ve never released confidential details but I was in a moment where there was obviously the loss of Anthoine which was really heavy to go through and to process The change of team at the same time There were a lot of things which were said which were not true or not with the right information For me I just felt okay this is also me This is Pierre Gasly this is how I am this is how I feel We re all human We can be athletes we are seen as athletes but at the end there is a human behind every driver There is hurt Emotions Mentality It just felt for me that it was important to kind of move on from this negative spiral which I had for these first six months It was just something important to myself And obviously by far the most challenging time I ve ever had to face as a driver Advert Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad free Rather than wilt Gasly met disappointment with determination Facing all his F dreams disappearing in front of him Gasly kept his chin up and got his head down Growing up I always believed in hard work and discipline and believing in that process that as long as you keep doing the right things the right outcome will happen at the end he explains A brief stint alongside Verstappen did not end well And that s the mentality I went through all these years I mean at this stage of my career these are the cards that I have in my hand How do I play best with what I have in my hand Whether it s the best cards or not doesn t matter This is my game and I got to make it work with these cards At the end of the day work doesn t lie Here we all talented Everyone that is in this paddock is special All brilliant drivers Some a bit more exceptional than others but at the end of the day we all are super talented And to make the difference you ve got to work on the small details that will bring you the X factor compared to others Still very much a part of the Red Bull ecosystem Gasly has only strengthened his case for a second shot at the factory seat now occupied by Sergio Perez since returning to AlphaTauri especially after claiming a stunning victory in Monza in and his regular top five qualifying results in Although he admits his admiration for the job Perez has been doing at Red Bull in Gasly says his sights are still set on reclaiming what was once his I feel ready he says I felt like I ve shown my potential I ve shown that I m able to deliver once I get the tools that I need in my hands to do it But then after I also understand them It s their decision I m fine with that I think what s important is that at the end of the day when you work with a team a team works with a driver or a driver works with a team there needs to be that common will and desire to do it together Whatever it takes There needs to be the will to do things together to have the same target in mind While he offers no excuses for the performance gap between himself and Verstappen over those early months of Gasly believes his abilities are so far beyond those he possessed three years ago that he is practically a different driver Monza is a career high Gasly is keen to repeat The driver I am today is way better than the driver I was after one year he insists If they saw at the time I was the right fit for the team after such a short time then now there are even more reasons to think I m prepared to get that seat Watching drivers younger than him secure long contracts that should keep them at the front of the field contending for podiums wins and even championships it would be easy for Gasly to become frustrated or even disillusioned with Red Bull However he says he values still being a part of Red Bull s programme and will wait for his opportunity even while he sits on the cusp of a fifth full season with AlphaTauri in I think I ve always said at the moment my priority is to discuss with Red Bull and they will always have the priority over others he says Because I m very grateful for everything they ve done in my career and that I m aware that I d never be here without the support of Helmut and Red Bull over these past years I ve told Helmut last time that actually this is the longest relationship I ve ever had in my life you know Nine years with Red Bull It s been eight and a half years of success fighting for all the best positions having a very very successful ride together There were the six months that didn t work out for the reasons that we know Compared to the consistent high performance Gasly and his team enjoyed last season has not started quite as successfully as either he or the factory would have wanted At the time of our chat Gasly lies th in the championship Although he echoes the thoughts of many of his fellow drivers that the new technical regulations for have achieved their goal of improving racing Gasly says he s not entirely satisfied with the impact the new rules have had so far Gasly hoped midfield would be more competitive this year From a racing point of view I must say it s been more fun he explains I think we did achieve some of the targets which were made with the regulation changes Is it as good as we would have liked As long as it s better for me I m not going to complain It has had a positive impact on the racing which is most important More overtaking being able to follow more closely The only thing is I wished that the whole field was closer than it is I was really hoping okay we can see more midfield cars getting closer to the podium positions And in the end last year I had more chances to be in the top five than I have this season So on that side it was the only little setback seeing at the start of the year that Ferrari is on a league of their own Red Bull sort of managed to get there as well And then after there is not like a small gap it s like a pretty big world to catch up with these guys So this is the only downside But I think it was more like dreaming this is achievable when we know in motorsport every time you ve got a regulation change Mercedes got the best of it the last eight years now Ferrari seems to get it right and slowly I think we re going to catch up but it s probably going to take time With his place at AlphaTauri and in Formula secured until at least the end of next season Gasly at least knows he has some time ahead to try and help build his team back up to the level of performance they enjoyed last year But he is also confident he will get an opportunity to make his case for a return to Milton Keynes at some point in the future This is a conversation we need to have that we didn t have yet he says Right now I probably think it might be too early because it s also only and the focus is on making the best season possible with AlphaTauri But I m sure there are going to be conversations and see what s good I know they are happy with the way it works for them at the moment and that also works for me Checo is doing very good there so it makes sense But then at the end of the day I also need to look at my own career and what s best for me what will give me the most chances to achieve my personal goals which is to be a world champion over the next few years Become a RaceFans Supporter

13,Formula may be able to eliminate the Drag Reduction System from future regulations if it can continue the progress it has made in encouraging cars to run together more closely ,Formula may be able to eliminate the Drag Reduction System from future regulations if it can continue the progress it has made in encouraging cars to run together more closely Advert Become a Supporter go ad free That s the view of the FIA s head of aerodynamics Jason Somerville He joined the sport s governing body earlier this year having spent five years at Formula where he developed the new technical rules which were introduced this year DRS was introduced to F in to help drivers make overtaking moves The new rules developed for this season were also designed to address that problem but Somerville said it became clear during their development that F wouldn t be able to do away with DRS immediately after their introduction During the initial research because we reduced the size of the hole that sits behind the car we reduced the downforce lost by a following car but we also reduced the tow he explained in an interview with Peter Windsor So we were a bit mindful that we probably weren t going to be able to just park DRS and remove it from the regulations However he indicated F s reliance on DRS to aid passes could be reduced and eventually removed I think DRS for us is a very tune able feature he said It s very circuit dependent and it can be dialled in and out I think most of us feel longer term we d very much like to try and phase DRS out if we can But we didn t think that was necessarily going to be the right thing to do overnight for these regulations Formula will introduce its next major revision of the technical regulations in four years time For the car we re looking at different solutions said Somerville And it may be that DRS doesn t have to have such an important role in the concept of those cars Advert Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad free During and after the last race at Imola several drivers claimed DRS should have been activated earlier than it was to aid overtaking However Somerville pointed out passes were made without DRS before then and few were afterwards I thought it was quite interesting that because we had this drying track we had almost half the racing with no DRS And I think it was interesting to see that there were a few overtakes that happened before the DRS got switched on but then the DRS was cancelling each other out Somerville believes F s four grands prix so far this year have shown the new rules have helped drivers race more closely This will inform F s thinking on how we prioritise DRS at the various events in future At the start we couldn t be sure that the teams wouldn t have undone half of the work that we d spent the last four years doing he said Now it looks like we ve managed to keep a lot of it so that has meant the teams can visibly run a lot closer through the corners and onto the next straight So we do get something that we haven t seen for a while actually an overtake happens but you look over your shoulder and he s still there and he comes back at you That s something that has been quite refreshing for the first few races at various points and it s not purely been DRS There s been DRS cat and mouse but I think we ve been quite pleased that the downforce retention is there We just need to be careful that we don t ignore the fact that naturally means the tow is a bit smaller So you kind of need the tow effect the big hole in the air behind you to give you a little bit of a boost if you haven t got DRS Advert Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad free F season Lack of passing at Imola shows why Ricciardo is still a DRS person Miami Grand Prix TV TimesShould Formula adopt IndyCar s deleted lap times rule for causing red flags in qualifying F to trial new mandatory qualifying tyre compound rule in No satisfaction in McLaren being quickest Mercedes powered team at Imola SeidlBrowse all F season articles,Keith Collantine,0.4250979106965022,0.12184074141820622,727,0.099,0.027,0.874,0.9941,Positive

his tenure with the team In fact Sainz does not need confidence He needs a load of points and even some wins from here to Monaco Otherwise Ferrari will be totally justified to concentrate on Leclerc The team really likes to push for a driver If only one driver has the luck talent to win and to beat Redbull then Sainz will have to accept a role Plus is starts with Leclerc World Champion the rest of his Carlos contract wil be like that Gusmaia Happy birthday Happy birthday to Alvino On this day in motorsport On this day in Mike Parkes won the non championship BRDC International Trophy driving
